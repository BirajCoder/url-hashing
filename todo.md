## Todo.md

- Deployment: The code is currently set up to run locally. Deploying it to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda function would be a good next step for production use.

- Authentication: Implement user authentication to secure certain routes and protect sensitive operations.

- Testing: Create unit tests and integration tests to ensure the application's reliability and functionality.

- Logging: Improve logging to capture important events and errors for monitoring and debugging.

- Security: Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection).

- Error Handling: Enhance error handling to provide meaningful error messages to users and log detailed error information.

- Load Balancing and Scalability: Plan for scalability and implement load balancing if the application experiences high traffic.

- User Interface (UI): Improve the UI for better user experience, especially for the dashboard.
